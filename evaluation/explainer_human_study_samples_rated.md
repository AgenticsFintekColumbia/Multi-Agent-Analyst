## Rating Guidelines

### Plausibility (1-5)
"Does this explanation feel like something a real sell-side analyst could plausibly have written as the reasoning behind the rating?"
- 1 = not at all
- 5 = extremely plausible

### Signal Coverage (1-5)
"Given the data shown to each agent (fundamental, technical, news), does the final explanation actually reference the most important signals?"
- 1 = major signals missing / made up
- 5 = covers key signals correctly

### Internal Consistency (1-5)
"Does the explainer's conclusion (e.g. why they rated SELL) follow logically from the signals it described?"
- 1 = contradicts itself
- 5 = strongly consistent

### Modality Checklist

- **mentions_fundamental:** If fundamental data exists, did the explanation talk about it? (yes/no/na)
- **mentions_technical:** If technical data exists, did the explanation talk about it? (yes/no/na)
- **mentions_news:** If news exists, did the explanation talk about it? (yes/no/na)
- **calls_out_missing_data:** If a modality is missing, does the explanation acknowledge that instead of hallucinating numbers? (yes/no/na)
